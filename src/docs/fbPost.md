üññ Assalamu Alaikum, Devs!

If you often work with long URLs and need to copy parts of them quickly, I made a simple **SurfingKeys** browser extension script (advanced mode) to help you do that with just a few keys.

Check the full code here:  
https://github.com/shahjalal-labs/surfingKeys/blob/main/src/modules/yank/urlYanker.js

### Real example with a long URL:

Say you‚Äôre on this URL:  
`http://localhost:5173/dashboard/tourist/manage-profile/edit/settings`

- Press **ag0** ‚Üí copies `http://localhost:5173` (the root URL only)
- Press **ag1** ‚Üí copies `settings` (last 1 segment of the path)
- Press **ag2** ‚Üí copies `edit/settings` (last 2 segments of the path)
- Press **ag3** ‚Üí copies `manage-profile/edit/settings` (last 3 segments)
- Press **ag4** ‚Üí copies `tourist/manage-profile/edit/settings` (last 4 segments)
- Press **ag,** ‚Üí opens `http://localhost:5173` in a new tab

### Why use this?

Copying parts of URLs manually takes time and causes mistakes. When testing routing daily, we can easily copy 20 to 30 URL parts or more. Doing it manually wastes valuable time.

This script saves you clicks and selections, making your workflow faster and smoother.

### Comfort and focus:

With just one or two key presses, you get exactly the URL part you want without breaking your flow or reaching for the mouse. It feels like you‚Äôre hacking through your tasks effortlessly ‚Äî pure keyboard ninja style. No distractions, just clean, efficient work.

### Time saved:

- About 25 copies daily, saving 5 seconds each = 125 seconds (~2 minutes) per day
- Over 260 working days = more than **8 hours saved every year**

Imagine gaining a full workday every year just by automating this small but repetitive task!

If you don‚Äôt use SurfingKeys yet, try it out. It‚Äôs perfect for developers who want to work smarter, not harder.
